<h3>Beware of Fake AniMixPlay</h3>
We have no app whatsoever. If you found any, they are fake app that use our name to gain attention. We are only available as a website in "<a href="index.html">animixplay.to</a>". Any other domains are fake, don't use them !
<br><h3 style="display: inline-block;">Progressive Web App</h3><br>
Our website support PWA. It's not an app but works very similar, it will add shortcut on your desktop/homescreen to open the website standalone like an app. Work in most browser in any platform.<br>
Open the website <a href="index.html">https://animixplay.to/</a> and click install button (if provided by your browser) or manually by 'add to homescreen' in browser menu.<br>
<h3>Tips for Searching</h3>
- Use anime info page 'related' tab to see sequel, prequel, ova, etc.<br>
- Use A-Z List if you want see everything at once, it have filter too.<br>
- See quick search while you type, it often already show what you want.<br>
- Use full search if quick search give no result.<br>

<h3 id="aboutstreams">About External Player</h3>
This open third party websites to play videos, may also display ads from there.<br>
<h3>About Internal Player (Switch)</h3>
This scrape video url from third party sites and then play it using our own video player.<br>
Internal player are not always available, and it may load bit slow on old anime.<br>
<h3>About multiple streams</h3>
Besides player & server options we also provide multiple stream options each taken from different websites. Use other stream if what you currently use have a problem.<br>
<h3>I have problem when playing video, what can i do?</h3>
1. Try reload the player.<br>
2. Try in incognito mode, disable browser extension, and clear browser cache.<br>
3. Try switch to external player then choose all different server. (Server options on top right or bottom right depend on what stream).<br>
4. If still have problem, try change stream.<br>
<img src="../cdn.animixplay.to/s/faq/player.jpg" />
<h3>I'm getting "Your browser deny localstorage..."</h3>
This is not a problem, just player can't remember last played position. If you want to allow playback progress saving, your browser setting shouldn't block cookies (that setting also block localstorage), read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Enable-Cookies-and-JavaScript">this tutorial</a> to allow it<br>
<h3>Why player in iOS different from other device?</h3>
HLS playback is forced to use iOS own system with no manual quality select, websites have very limited control over how the player behaves.<br>
All browsers in iOS are the same. Just get used to it, or use another device.<br>
<h3>Website Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
L : toggle lights<br>
] : go to next episode<br>
[ : go to previous episode<br>
. : next frame<br>
, : previous frame<br>
Shift + ←/→ : seek 85s (skip opening)<br>
<br>
Standard video player keys :<br>
Space, F, K, M, ←, →, ↑, ↓<br>
<br>
Mobile touch screen :<br>
Swipe left/right : variable seeking<br>
←/→ button (double tap) : seek 85s (skip opening)<br>
<h3>What is sandbox on/off ?</h3>
Sandbox will prevent external player to open any popup, mainly used to block popads, some server not allow you to use sandbox so you can turn it off if neccesary.<br>
<h3>When will X released?</h3>
We don't upload any anime, it will exist on animixplay if it also exist on other website. Also note about movie, it usually exist on websites only if digital copy released, not when on theater.<br>
<h3>About anime release schedule & countdown</h3>
Schedule is a rough estimation, release depend on a lot other factor. Countdown also the same, it's based on schedule.<br>
Dub doesn't have release schedule because most of dub doesn't release weekly, and not broadcasted on TV<br>
<h3>What number on sidebar tracking mean?</h3>
Current ep : episode played right now<br>
Tracked : what recorded in account<br>
Finish this eps : mark current episode as finished (move 'tracked' to next episode)<br>
Sync tracking : force manually set tracked to current ep (useful for move back episode or when not using autotracking)<br>
<img src="../cdn.animixplay.to/s/faq/sidebar.jpg" style="margin: 10px 0 -15px 0;" />
<h3>My episode progress is wrong, How do I edit it manually?</h3>
Open the episode you want, then click 'Sync tracking' at right menu.<br>
<h3>What is followed anime?</h3>
It's to follow anime updates, it will displayed in follow tab with the number of new episodes you haven't watch, or if you watched all the episodes it display a timer countdown to the next episode.<br>
You can only follow ongoing anime, this is separate from your watchlist, you can unfollow anime without it being removed from your watchlist.<br>
<img src="../cdn.animixplay.to/s/faq/followtab.jpg" />
<h3>How i 'bookmark' an anime?</h3>
Add anime to your watchlist by clicking the +watchlist button on the stream page, you can manage your watchlist in user panel.<br>
You can also 'follow' airing anime to keep up to date with the new episodes release.<br>
<h3>Why i can't follow an anime?</h3>
Follow is only used for airing series (to track new episodes) so if an anime is already completed then you can't follow them.<br>
You however can still add that anime to your watchlist. <br>
<h3>How can i rate / recommend anime?</h3>
go to <a target="_blank" href="https://myanimelist.net/">https://myanimelist.net</a> to rate anime, we get the rating data from there.<br>
<h3>How are watchlist arranged?</h3>
List is in chronological order. latest anime you watch will be on top.<br>
<h3>Can i delete my account?</h3>
Yes, please delete your account if it not used anymore. Go to 'user panel' then click 'Account' on right menu, in there you will find button to permanently delete your account. All data in server is instantly gone after you click confirm.<br>
<h3>When I finish an anime, will it automatically go back to my watchlist once a new episode is released?</h3>
no, if you finish an anime it mean finish the whole series. so it will stay as finished even new episode come out.<br>
if it still airing better to let it in your watchlist.<br>
<h3>How to change video quality?</h3>
Check player setting at bottom right of video. If not exist, try switch to external player. try server StreamSB, Multi quality, or Xstream.<br>
The quality option place is different depending on the player, usually at bottom right.<br>
multiple quality is not always available. Different stream also can have different quality.<br>
<h3>How to remove black bars in my phone?</h3>
not possible here, because it's the correct video shape<br>
The problem is your phone's screen size. If you really want to do that download the video & play it using another video player that have that setting.<br>
<h3>How to reset password?</h3>
if you still logged-in, you can reset password by follow instruction in help page at user panel.<br>
But if you not logged-in, nothing you can do, that's why we ask you to use password manager.<br>
<h3 style="display: inline-block;">Stream Types</h3> (not always true, just generalization)<br>
GOGO : can switch player, have multiple servers, best anime availability.<br>
AL : Vary wildly between anime, may have dozen option, but may aslo dead.<br>
RUSH : mp4upload player, last resort to use if other stream didn't give good result.<br>
<h3>What difference between streams & servers?</h3>
Stream : website source, different stream can be different video encoding, quality, subtitles, etc.<br>
Server : mirror host on same video stream.<br>
<h3>Why the video buffering? my internet is good</h3>
Can be server busy, or your ISP intentionally/technical issue causing the speed for the video drop, try switch to external player, or change server.<br>
if that doesn't work, switch the stream, switch internet connection, use VPN, or wait some time later.<br>
<h3>"help page" in User Panel for account related info & tutorial</h3>
<img src="../cdn.animixplay.to/s/faq/upanel.jpg" />
<h3>Autoplay & Autonext support?</h3>
Yes, on all internal player.<br>
<h3>Cast support?</h3>
in iOS use airplay (button in bottom right), chromecast need app, while on android use this app <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instantbits.cast.webvideo">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instantbits.cast.webvideo</a><br>
<h3>MAL Sync?</h3>
Use malsync browser extension (<a target="_blank" href="https://malsync.moe/">https://malsync.moe/</a>) for sync.<br>
built in animixplay only import & export, not sync.<br>
<h3>Watch together feature?</h3>
Use dedicated website/extension like <a target="_blank" href="https://getmetastream.com/">https://getmetastream.com/</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://watch.hyperbeam.com/">https://watch.hyperbeam.com/</a> it is better because you can use that for any site.<br>
